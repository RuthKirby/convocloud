# convocloud

ConvoCloud is an app that provides a real-time visualisation of the semantic content of spoken language. It achieves this by integrating the technologies of Automatic Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing and Word Cloud imagery.

# Use Cases

With fixes and additions it could possibly be used by those with hearing impairments as an assistive tool for capturing the topics of a spoken conversation. Other possible use cases include lectures, meetings and other scenarios where a semantic summary of what is being said would be useful.
